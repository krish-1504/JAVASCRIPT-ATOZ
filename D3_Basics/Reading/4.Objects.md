## Objects :
In JavaScript, the (this) keyword refers to an object.

In an object method, (this) refers to the object.

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Dates are always objects
Maths are always objects
Regular expressions are always objects
Arrays are always objects
Functions are always objects
Objects are always objects
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.


## Primitives :
A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

Examples
string
number
boolean
null
undefined
symbol
bigint


## Immutable
Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).

if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14.

Objects Are Variables...


## Accessing JavaScript Properties
objectName.property      // person.age
objectName["property"]   // person["age"]
objectName[expression]   // x = "age"; person[x]

## itereting a object 
for (let variable in object) {
  // code to be executed
}


## Keys and Values
Object.keys(car)
Object.values(car)

## geter and setter
const car = {
    brand :"Mahindra",
    Model :"XUV300",
    get md(){
        return this.Model ;
    },
    set brnd(brnd){
        this.brand = brnd;
    }
}

## By Prototype You Can Add New Properties to Object

Person.prototype.nationality = "English";
